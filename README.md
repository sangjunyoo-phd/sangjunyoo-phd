Hi, I am Sangjun Yoo. A soft-matter physics researcher specialized in analyzing nano-scale structure of air-water interface using synchrotron source X-rays:
5+ years of experience on researching adsorption properties of rare-earth elements to a charged floating monolayer and their application to rare-earth separation.

I am currently interested in Machine Learning & Deep Learning and their application to solve the real-world problems.
